# College Scorecard Explorer

Is a purely client side project that pulls data from the college scorecard web api. The purpose of the project is to gain experience creating a vanilla react app, without the benefits and complications of a full-stack framework like Next.js

## Goals

- Improve REACT knowledge
- Learn patterns of interaction between components
- Create a meaningful portfolio piece 
- Create a progressive web app
- Incrementally add bells and whistles
